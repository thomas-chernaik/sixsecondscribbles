        <h1>Welcome to Six Second Scribbles!</h1>
        <p class="lead">Six second scribbles is a game you play with friends. Gather in the same room or on a call, and
            start scribbling!</p>

        <h2>Gameplay Basics</h2>
        <p>The goal of Six Second Scribbles is to draw things and earn points. The player with the most points at the
            end wins the game.</p>
        <p>The game consists of rounds, and you can play as many rounds as you'd like. Each round you will be given a
            new card to draw, and a new opponent to guess for.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-4">
        <h2>Round Structure</h2>
        <p>Each round is split into two phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Drawing Phase:</strong> Players receive ten prompts and a category. You have 60 seconds to
                draw as many prompts as you can.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Guessing Phase:</strong> Each player receives another player's drawing card, and has to
                guess as many prompts as possible. Both the guesser and the artist earn points for correct guesses.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The drawer will mark correct guesses by clicking on each prompt the guesser gets right. Let the points roll
            in!</p>
        <p>After the guessing phase, see the leaderboard and vote on the difficulty for the next round.</p>

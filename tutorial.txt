Six second scribbles is a card game you play with friends.
It is important that you can talk to your friends while you play, so you'll need to be in the same room, or on call.
The winner of the game has the most points when the game ends.
The game is split up into rounds, and you can play as many rounds as you want.
Each round has a difficulty, which you choose before you play.
The rounds consist of two phases.
In the first phase, each player will recieve ten prompts to draw, and a category which these prompts belong to.
They will then have 60 seconds to draw as many of these prompts as they can.
The second phase will begin immediately after the first phase ends.
You will be shown the drawings of one other player, and their username.
You have to guess as many of their prompts as you can from their drawing.
You will both be awarded points for each correct guess.
You log the correct guess by clicking on each prompt that the guesser got right.
In each round, you will be shown a different player's drawings.
After everyone has submitted their guesses, the round will end.
The leaderboard will be shown, and the difficulty for the next round can be voted on.
The game will end when you decide to stop playing.
